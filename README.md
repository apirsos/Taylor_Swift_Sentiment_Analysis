# Taylor_Swift_Sentiment_Analysis
This is a sentiment analysis of Taylor Swift's lyrics from her first 6 albums. 

This analysis was part of a larger NLP project I completed with 4 other teammates during graduate school. Their components analyzed Taylor's word choice and topic clustering by album. This project contains the original csv, the sentiment analysis in Python, and the significance testing in R.
